But first, users should become familiar with a conceptual overview of the MSE process and the primary objects and functions.\nopenMSE is designed around an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, where the code is organized around objects, which contain relevant data, and functions (methods) that operate on those data.\nFigure 2.1 shows a conceptual overview of the MSE process in openMSE, with colors indicating the primary objects and functions.\nThe following sub-sections describe these primary objects and the functions that either operate on them, or are used to create them.\nflowchart TD\n  build([Build])\n  condition[[Condition]]\n  import[[Import]]\n  convert[[Convert]]\n  om[OM]\n  build:::process --&gt; om\n  condition:::function --&gt; om\n  import:::function --&gt; om\n  convert:::function --&gt; om\n  sim[[Simulate]]\n  om:::object --&gt; sim:::function\n  hist[Hist]\n  sim --&gt; hist:::object\n  mp[[MP]]\n  project[[Project]]\n  hist:::object --&gt; project:::function\n  mp:::function --&gt; project\n  mse[MSE]\n  project --&gt; mse:::object\n\nclassDef process fill:#fe218b, stroke:#111,stroke-width:1px, color:#000\nclassDef function fill:#fed700, stroke:#111,stroke-width:1px, color:#000\nclassDef object fill:#21b0fe, stroke:#111,stroke-width:1px, color:#000\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: An overview of the primary objects and functions used in the MSE process.",

The following package versions are required to use openMSE v2.0:\nThe openMSE v2.0 packages are completely backwards compatible with earlier versions, so all code developed using earlier versions of openMSE and its component packages should still work without any changes. Please file an issue if you experience issues where openMSE 2.0 has caused issues with existing code.\nOther than fixes to maintain backwards compatibility, the legacy code base will not be updated.

    "text": "2.2 The OM Object\nThe Operating Model (OM) object is the main component of the MSE framework. An OM describes the characteristics of a fishery system and contains all the information required to simulate the population and fleet dynamics, the collection of fishery data, and the application of a management procedure.\nThere are several ways to construct an OM (Figure 2.1). These methods are briefly described in the sections below.\n\n2.2.1 Build an OM\nThe first method, indicated by Build in Figure 2.1, is a process rather than applying a single function.\nThe build process involves creating a new OM object, and manually populating the various elements of the object using a combination of expert judgement and available fishery data.\nThis process is most often used in data-limited situations, where there is insufficient data or information to use one of the other approaches.\nThe Example of the MSE Process section provides an example of using the Build process to construct an OM.\nAlthough this method may not be commonly used in practice, users are recommended to read start with Example of the MSE Process to familiarize themselves to the structure and contents of OM objects.\n\n\n2.2.2 Condition an OM\nOperating models are often generated by fitting a fishery population dynamics model to time-series fishery data (e.g., historical catches, indices of abundance, age and/or length compositions).\nThis process is known as OM conditioning, and is analogous to a conventional stock assessment. However, unlike a stock assessment where the aim is to provide a scientific estimate of the status of the stock (e.g., current biomass relative to a biological reference point), OMs are designed to incorporate the key uncertainties in the knowledge of the fishery system. In other words, while a stock assessment produces a single estimate of the historical fishery dynamics (aka the ‘best model’ approach), an operating model accounts for uncertainties and contains many different hypotheses of plausible fishery dynamics.\nopenMSE's Rapid Conditioning Model (RCM) is designed to condition operating models for a wide range of life-history types and data availability scenarios.\nChapter 11 provides an example of using the Condition function to condition an OM from fishery data.\n\n\n2.2.3 Import an OM\nopenMSE supports importing operating models from several commonly used stock assessment frameworks, including Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) and the Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM).\nChapter 5 provides an example of using the Import function to import an OM from stock assessment output.\n\n\n2.2.4 Convert an OM\nThe Convert function is used to convert OM objects (as well as other objects) that were created in earlier versions of openMSE (see Chapter 1) to the new object structure developed in openMSE 2.0.\nChapter 6 provides an example of using the Convert function to convert OM objects developed with earlier versions of openMSE to be compatible with openMSE 2.0.",

See the Ages section below for an example.\nAdditionally, because it is used to set up the time and age structure of the model, the Seasons value should not be changed once an operating model is constructed.",

This information is primarily used for two purposes:\n\nCalculating mean weight-at-age from a length-weight relationship a the mean length-at-age\nCalculating the age-length key for converting at-age values (such as maturity-at-age) to at-length (i.e., maturity-at-length) and vice versa, and for generating catch-at-length data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Length object is optional if no other objects are a function of length (e.g., Weight, Maturity, Fecundity and Selectivity etc in the Fleet object, and there is no requirement to generate catch-at-length data.\n\n\nThe Length() function is used to create Length objects.\nThe help documentation for this function (?Length) provides details on the contents of the Length object and a description of the arguments for the Length() function (Figure 3.1).\nUsers must provide information to populate MeanAtAge and CVatAge in a Length object.\nMeanAtAge is common to all objects that contain at-age information, and, as the name suggests, contains information describing the mean at-age schedule (in this case the mean length-at-age).\nCVatAge contains the coefficient of variability for the distribution of length-at-age, which can be either normally (Dist='normal') or log-normally (Dist='lognormal') distributed around MeanAtAge.\nUltimately both MeanAtAge and CVatAge will be internally 3-dimensional arrays with dimensions containing values for each simulation, age-class, and historical and projection time step (typically years but as noted above, for seasonal models the time steps will actually be decimal years). However, the openMSE objects have been designed such that users only need to enter the minimal information to populate the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Screenshot of the help documentation for the Length function\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Methods for Populating Age- and Time-Dynamic Values\nFigure 3.1 shows the that default value for CVatAge is a single numeric value 0.1. This value will be converted internally to an array with the correct dimensions, with a CV of 0.1 for all simulations, ages, and time steps.\nThere are several ways to include uncertainty in the values for CVatAge , and have it vary by simulation, age, and/or time step. These approaches are described in the sub-sections below. In general, all age- and time-dynamic values can be populated in the same manner.\n\n3.3.3.1 Stochastic Samples from a Uniform Distribution\nThe easiest way to include uncertainty is to sample from a uniform distribution. To do this, enter to numeric values representing the lower and upper bounds of a uniform distribution:\n\nLength_CV_uniform &lt;- Length(CVatAge = c(0.1, 0.2))\n\nThe above code creates a new Length class object with only the CVatAge slot populated.\nThis object is processed internally to sample from a uniform distribution with these bounds and produce an array with the correct dimensions.\nThis is done internally by the Populate function, which is run here on the Length_CV_uniform object to demonstrate:\n\nLength_CV_uniform &lt;- Populate(Length_CV_uniform,\n  Ages = Ages(SimpleStock),\n  Years = Years(SimpleStock),\n  nSim = nSim(SimpleOM),\n  seed = 101\n)\n\nIn practice, users will rarely need to call the Populate function as this processing is done internally in the Simulate function.\nCVatAge in Length_CV_uniform is now a 3-dimensional array:\n\nLength_CV_uniform |&gt; \n  CVatAge() |&gt; \n  dim()\n\n[1] 5 1 1\n\n\nwith the value for each simulation drawn from a uniform distribution with the specified bounds:\n\nLength_CV_uniform |&gt;\n  CVatAge()\n\n, , Year = 2006\n\n   Age\nSim         0\n  1 0.1372198\n  2 0.1043825\n  3 0.1709684\n  4 0.1657690\n  5 0.1249856\n\n\nOnce an object has been populated by Populate , all dimensions will be named:\n\nLength_CV_uniform |&gt; \n  CVatAge() |&gt; \n  dimnames()\n\n$Sim\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n\n$Age\n[1] \"0\"\n\n$Year\n[1] \"2006\"\n\n\nNotice that while CVatAge is a 3-dimensional array, the dimensions Age and Year are only length 1 and named as the first age-class and year respectively. This is because CVatAge in this example only varies by simulation and is constant for all ages-classes and years. Internally, the array will be expanded out for all age-classes and years.\nThe values for CVatAge can also be entered as a vector of length nSim (provided nSim &gt; 1 ). The following are will result in the same output:\n\n# numeric length nSim\nset.seed(101)\nCVatAge &lt;- runif(nSim(SimpleOM), 0.1, 0.2)\n\nLength_CV_uniform_1 &lt;- Length(CVatAge = CVatAge) |&gt;\n  Populate(\n    Ages = Ages(SimpleStock),\n    Years = Years(SimpleStock),\n    nSim = nSim(SimpleOM)\n  )\n\nLength_CV_uniform_1 |&gt; \n  CVatAge()\n\n, , Year = 2006\n\n   Age\nSim         0\n  1 0.1372198\n  2 0.1043825\n  3 0.1709684\n  4 0.1657690\n  5 0.1249856\n\n\nThis approach can be also used to sample values from different distributions, for example:\n\n# Sample from log-normal distribution\nset.seed(101)\nCVatAge &lt;- trlnorm(nSim(SimpleOM), 0.15, 0.2)\n\nLength_CV_lognorm &lt;- Length(CVatAge = CVatAge) |&gt;\n  Populate(\n    Ages = Ages(SimpleStock),\n    Years = Years(SimpleStock),\n    nSim = nSim(SimpleOM)\n  )\n\nLength_CV_lognorm |&gt; \n  CVatAge()\n\n, , Year = 2006\n\n   Age\nSim         0\n  1 0.1378900\n  2 0.1640934\n  3 0.1286837\n  4 0.1534657\n  5 0.1564240\n\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Age-Specific Values\nAge-specific values can be generated by specifying CVatAge as an array with dimensions nSim and nAge :\n\nset.seed(101)\nCVatAge &lt;- array(runif(nSim(SimpleOM) * \n                         nAge(SimpleStock), \n                       0.1, 0.2),\n  dim = c(\n    nSim(SimpleOM),\n    nAge(SimpleStock)\n  )\n)\n\nLength_CV_uniform_Age &lt;- Length(CVatAge = CVatAge) |&gt;\n  Populate(\n    Ages = Ages(SimpleStock),\n    Years = Years(SimpleStock),\n    nSim = nSim(SimpleOM)\n  )\n\nLength_CV_uniform_Age |&gt;\n  CVatAge() |&gt;\n  dimnames()\n\n$Sim\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n\n$Age\n [1] \"0\"  \"1\"  \"2\"  \"3\"  \"4\"  \"5\"  \"6\"  \"7\"  \"8\"  \"9\"  \"10\" \"11\" \"12\" \"13\" \"14\"\n[16] \"15\" \"16\" \"17\" \"18\" \"19\" \"20\"\n\n$Year\n[1] \"2006\"\n\n\n\n3.3.3.3 Time- and Age-Specific Values\nThe same approach can be used to generate values that vary of both age and time:\n\nset.seed(101)\nCVatAge &lt;- array(runif(nSim(SimpleOM) * \n                         nAge(SimpleStock) * \n                         length(Years(SimpleOM)), \n                       0.1, 0.2),\n  dim = c(\n    nSim(SimpleOM),\n    nAge(SimpleStock),\n    length(Years(SimpleOM))\n  )\n)\n\nLength_CV_uniform_Age_Time &lt;- Length(CVatAge = CVatAge) |&gt;\n  Populate(\n    Ages = Ages(SimpleStock),\n    Years = Years(SimpleStock),\n    nSim = nSim(SimpleOM)\n  )\n\nLength_CV_uniform_Age_Time |&gt;\n  CVatAge() |&gt;\n  dimnames()\n\n$Sim\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n\n$Age\n [1] \"0\"  \"1\"  \"2\"  \"3\"  \"4\"  \"5\"  \"6\"  \"7\"  \"8\"  \"9\"  \"10\" \"11\" \"12\" \"13\" \"14\"\n[16] \"15\" \"16\" \"17\" \"18\" \"19\" \"20\"\n\n$Year\n [1] \"2006\" \"2007\" \"2008\" \"2009\" \"2010\" \"2011\" \"2012\" \"2013\" \"2014\" \"2015\"\n[11] \"2016\" \"2017\" \"2018\" \"2019\" \"2020\" \"2021\" \"2022\" \"2023\" \"2024\" \"2025\"\n[21] \"2026\" \"2027\" \"2028\" \"2029\" \"2030\" \"2031\" \"2032\" \"2033\" \"2034\" \"2035\"\n\n\n\n3.3.3.4 Populating MeanAtAge\n\nThe section above\nHere the process to create and populate a Length object is broken into several steps. In practice this can be done in one or two lines of code.\nCreate a new Length object:\nThe mean length-at-age schedule is stored in a slot named MeanAtAge, which can be specified in two ways:\n\nA growth model and a list of the respective parameter values\nDirectly as an array specifying the mean length-at-age for each simulation and year.\n\n3.3.3.5 Model and Parameters\nThe Model and Pars slots are used to generate the mean length-at-age.\nModel specifies the growth function, and Pars is a named list with the parameter values.\nIf the names in Pars corresponds with a built-in growth model, Model will be set automatically and does not need to be defined. Alternatively, Model can be a R function that takes an Ages object as the first argument followed by the additional parameters that describe the mean length-at-age relationship.\nCurrently openMSE includes one built-in growth model: the von Bertalanffy growth function:\n\\[\nL_a = L_\\infty(1-\\exp(-K(a-t_0))\n\\] In general, a list of built-in models for a specific object class can be printed to the console with [CLASS]Models(), for example:\n\nLengthModels()\n\nModel: `?MSEtool::vonBert()`\n\n\nPars: `Linf`, `K`, and `t0`\n\n\nOther argument(s): `Ages`\n\n\nClass: `Length-at-Age-Model`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# DefaultLength &lt;- Length()\n#\n# Populate(DefaultLength)\n#\n# ?Populate\n#\n# Length(SimpleStock) &lt;- Length()\n#\n# Populate(Length(SimpleStock))\n#\n# Pars=list(Linf=c(121, 135),\n#           K=c(0.16, 0.22),\n#           t0=c(-1.86, -1.41))\n\n\n# Redundant - 1D array with dimension nSim\n\n\n# Redundant - 2D array with dimensions, nSim\nset.seed(101)\nCVatAge &lt;- array(runif(nSim(SimpleOM), 0.1, 0.2),\n  dim = c(nSim(SimpleOM), 1)\n)\n\nLength_CV_uniform_2 &lt;- Length(CVatAge = CVatAge) |&gt;\n  Populate(\n    Ages = Ages(SimpleStock),\n    Years = Years(SimpleStock),\n    nSim = nSim(SimpleOM)\n  )\n\nCVatAge(Length_CV_uniform_2)\n\n, , Year = 2006\n\n   Age\nSim         0\n  1 0.1372198\n  2 0.1043825\n  3 0.1709684\n  4 0.1657690\n  5 0.1249856\n\n# Redundant - 3D array with dimensions, nSim, 1, 1\nset.seed(101)\nCVatAge &lt;- array(runif(nSim(SimpleOM), 0.1, 0.2),\n  dim = c(nSim(SimpleOM), 1, 1)\n)\n\nLength_CV_uniform_3 &lt;- Length(CVatAge = CVatAge) |&gt;\n  Populate(\n    Ages = Ages(SimpleStock),\n    Years = Years(SimpleStock),\n    nSim = nSim(SimpleOM)\n  )\n\nCVatAge(Length_CV_uniform_3)\n\n, , Year = 2006\n\n   Age\nSim         0\n  1 0.1372198\n  2 0.1043825\n  3 0.1709684\n  4 0.1657690\n  5 0.1249856\n\n\nModel can either be a character string specifying the name of the growth model corresponding with the named parameters in Pars, or\n\n3.3.3.6 Assign Array Directly\n\n3.3.3.7 Other Information\n\n3.3.4 Weight\n\n3.3.5 NaturalMortality\n\n3.3.6 Maturity\n\n3.3.7 Fecundity\n\n3.3.8 SRR\n\n3.3.9 Spatial\n\n3.3.10 Depletion",

    "text": "1.2 Overview of Major Changes\nThis section is primarily relevant to readers who have been working with openMSE in the past and are interested in learning about the technical differences between openMSE 2.0 and earlier versions of the packages.\nThe majority of the new developments have occurred in the MSEtool package. The most significant changes are the development of new object classes and new accessor and assignment functions related to those objects.\nTable 1.1 provides on overview of the new object classes, and some examples of the accessor and assignment functions that operate on those objects.\nLowercase names are used for all new object classes, however the accessor and assignment functions use either uppercase for acronyms (e.g., OM()) or regular case (e.g., Stock()).\nThe function examples in Table 1.1 are primarily intended for demonstration purposes and, particularly the assignment functions, in practice may require additional arguments. Consult the help documentation for the respective object class (e.g., ?OM ) for further information.\nThe new object classes and related functions are described in more detail elsewhere in this manual.\n\n\nTable 1.1: A brief description of the primary new object classes developed for openMSE 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Class\nDescription\nKey Functions Examples\nDeprecated Class\n\n\n\nom\n\nS4 object containing the operating model information.\nUsed for both single-stock/fleet and multi-stock/fleet models.\n\n\nOM(): Create new om-class object\n\nOM\nMOM\n\n\n\nstock\nS4 object containing information relating to the biological characteristics of a stock.\n\nStock() : Create a new stock-class object\nStock(OM) : Access a stock-class object from an om-class object\nStock(OM) &lt;- Stock() : Assign a stock-class object to an om-class object\n\nStock\n\n\nfleet\nS4 object containing information relating to the exploitation characteristics of a stock.\n\nFleet() : Create a new fleet-class object\nFleet(OM): Access a fleet-class object from an om-class object\nFleet(OM) &lt;- Fleet() : Assign a fleet-class object to an om-class object\n\nFleet\n\n\nobs\nS4 object containing information related to the observation model used to generate fishery data.\n\nObs() : Create a new obs-class object\nObs(OM): Access an obs-class object from an om-class object\nObs(OM) &lt;- Obs() : Assign an obs-class object to an om-class object\n\nObs\n\n\nimp\n\nS4 object containing information related to the implementation error for management advice produced by management procedures.\nNote: Implementation error is currently not implemented in openMSE 2.0 .\n\n\nImp() : Create a new imp-class object\nImp(OM): Access an imp-class object from an om-class object\nImp(OM) &lt;- Imp() : Assign an imp-class object to an om-class object\n\nImp\n\n\ndata\n\nS4 object containing information related to fishery data.\nA data-class object contains the data from all fleets in an OM .\nEach OM has a data-class object for each Stock , or for each stock complex.\n\n\nData() : Create a new data-class object\nData(OM): Access a data-class object from an om-class object\nData(OM) &lt;- Data() : Assign a data-class object to an om-class object\n\nData\n\n\nmp\nFunction that takes a data -class object and returns an advice-class object.\nMyMP &lt;- function(Data, ...) {\nAdvice()\n}\nclass(MyMP) &lt;- 'mp'\nMP\n\n\nadvice\nS4 object returned by a mp-class function and containing information related management advice.\n\nAdvice(): Create a new advice-class object\nRec\n\n\nhist\n\nS4 object containing the simulated historical fishery and information for future population dynamics.\nUsed for both single-stock/fleet and multi-stock/fleet models.\n\n\nHist(MSE) : return historical time series information from an mse-class object.\nNote: The object returned by Hist(MSE) is not a complete hist-class object, but only contains the historical time series data.

Seasonality can be added to the model by assigning a value to the Seasons slot of the OM object:\n\nSeasons(SimpleOM) &lt;- 4 # 4-quarters\nYears(SimpleOM, \"H\") |&gt; head(8)\n\n[1] 2001.000 2001.247 2001.496 2001.748 2002.000 2002.247 2002.496 2002.748\n\n\nAs shown above, Seasons changes the values of the historical and projection years into decimal years corresponding with the specified number of seasons within a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid using assigning values with @\n\n\n\nAlmost all openMSE objects have been developed using the R S4 system.\nS4 objects contain slots, named components of the object that can be accessed using the @ operator (this is analogous to using the $ symbol to access contents of S3 objects), for example:\n\nslotNames(SimpleOM)\n\n [1] \"Name\"        \"Agency\"      \"Author\"      \"Email\"       \"Region\"     \n [6] \"Latitude\"    \"Longitude\"   \"Sponsor\"     \"nSim\"        \"nYear\"      \n[11] \"pYear\"       \"CurrentYear\" \"Stock\"       \"Fleet\"       \"Obs\"        \n[16] \"Imp\"         \"Data\"        \"DataLag\"     \"CatchFrac\"   \"Allocation\" \n[21] \"EFactor\"     \"Complexes\"   \"SexPars\"     \"Relations\"   \"Interval\"   \n[26] \"nReps\"       \"pStar\"       \"maxF\"        \"Seed\"        \"Seasons\"    \n[31] \"Years\"       \"Control\"     \"Misc\"        \"Log\"         \"Source\"     \n\nSimpleOM@nSim\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe @ symbol can be used to assign new values to slots, for example:\n\nSimpleOM@nSim &lt;- 5\n\nHowever, while earlier versions of openMSE advocated using the @ symbol to access slots and assign new values, this practice is not recommended for openMSE 2.0.\nInstead, users are encouraged to use the accessor and assignment functions that have been developed for each object class.\nThis is especially important when assigning new values, where the assignment functions may have side effects that will be missed if the @ symbol is used for assigning new values to an object.\nFor example, consider the Seasons assignment function:\n\n`Seasons&lt;-`\n\nfunction(x, value) {\n  CheckClass(x)\n  x@Seasons &lt;- value\n  x@Years &lt;- CalcYears(x@nYear, x@pYear, x@CurrentYear, x@Seasons)\n  x\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x000001d6ff1167e8&gt;\n&lt;environment: namespace:MSEtool&gt;\n\n\nNote that in addition to assigning the new value to the Seasons slot, the Seasons assignment function also recalculates the values for the Years slot, a step that would have been missed if the new value was assigned directly using the @ symbol and would lead to unexpected errors.\n\n\nIf required, the lubridate package can be used to convert decimal years into dates (and back again):\n\nSimpleOM |&gt;\n  Years() |&gt;\n  lubridate::date_decimal() |&gt;\n  lubridate::as_date() |&gt;\n  head()\n\n[1] \"2001-01-01\" \"2001-04-01\" \"2001-07-01\" \"2001-09-30\" \"2002-01-01\"\n[6] \"2002-04-01\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe Seasons value in the OM defines the number of historical and projection time steps, as well as the structure of the age classes for all stocks in the OM.\nThe accounting in openMSE always starts at the beginning of the first historical year (i.e., Years(SimpleOM)[1]) and moves sequentially through the annual or seasonal time steps in Years(SimpleOM).\nAll stocks must have the same time units as the OM. See the Ages section below for an example.\nAdditionally, because it is used to set up the time and age structure of the model, the Seasons value should not be changed once an operating model is constructed.",

The other sub-objects with a similar structure are described in less detail.\nReaders should refer back to this section for the specific details for the different ways to populate those objects.\n\n\nThe Length object describes the mean length-at-age schedule and how length-at-age is distributed around the mean. This information is primarily used for two purposes:\n\nCalculating mean weight-at-age from a length-weight relationship a the mean length-at-age\nCalculating the age-length key for converting at-age values (such as maturity-at-age) to at-length (i.e., maturity-at-length) and vice versa, and for generating catch-at-length data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Length object is optional if no other objects are a function of length (e.g., Weight, Maturity, Fecundity and Selectivity etc in the Fleet object, and there is no requirement to generate catch-at-length data.\n\n\nThe Length() function is used to create Length objects.\nThe help documentation for this function (?Length) provides details on the contents of the Length object and a description of the arguments for the Length() function (Figure 4.1).\nUsers must provide information to populate MeanAtAge and CVatAge in a Length object.\nMeanAtAge is common to all objects that contain at-age information, and, as the name suggests, contains information describing the mean at-age schedule (in this case the mean length-at-age).\nCVatAge contains the coefficient of variability for the distribution of length-at-age, which can be either normally (Dist='normal') or log-normally (Dist='lognormal') distributed around MeanAtAge.\nUltimately both MeanAtAge and CVatAge will be internally 3-dimensional arrays with dimensions containing values for each simulation, age-class, and historical and projection time step (typically years but as noted above, for seasonal models the time steps will actually be decimal years). However, the openMSE objects have been designed such that users only need to enter the minimal information to populate the model.\nThe methodology to populate age- and time-dynamic values is similar for all objects that contain MeanAtAge (and CVatAge where applicable). The next section describes this process in detail for Length objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Screenshot of the help documentation for the Length function",

    "text": "4.4 Methods for Populating Age- and Time-Dynamic Values\n\n4.4.1 Populating CVatAge\n\nFigure 4.1 shows the that default value for CVatAge is a single numeric value 0.1. This value will be converted internally to an array with the correct dimensions, with a CV of 0.1 for all simulations, ages, and time steps.\nThere are several ways to include uncertainty in the values for CVatAge , and have it vary by simulation, age, and/or time step. These approaches are described in the sub-sections below. In general, all age- and time-dynamic values can be populated in the same manner.\n\n4.4.1.1 Stochastic Samples from Distributions\nThe easiest way to include uncertainty is to sample from a uniform distribution. To do this, enter to numeric values representing the lower and upper bounds of a uniform distribution:\nThe above code creates a new Length class object with only the CVatAge slot populated.\nThis object is processed internally to sample from a uniform distribution with these bounds and produce an array with the correct dimensions.\nThis is done internally by the Populate function, which is run here on the Length_CV_uniform object to demonstrate:\nIn practice, users will rarely need to call the Populate function as this processing is done internally in the Simulate function.\nCVatAge in Length_CV_uniform is now a 3-dimensional array:\nwith the value for each simulation drawn from a uniform distribution with the specified bounds:\nOnce an object has been populated by Populate , all dimensions will be named:\nNotice that while CVatAge is a 3-dimensional array, the dimensions Age and Year are only length 1 and named as the first age-class and year respectively. This is because CVatAge in this example only varies by simulation and is constant for all ages-classes and years. Internally, the array will be expanded out for all age-classes and years.\nThe values for CVatAge can also be entered as a vector of length nSim (provided nSim &gt; 2 ). The following are will result in the same output as the code above:\nThis approach can be also used to sample values from different distributions, for example:\n\n4.4.1.2 Age-Specific Values\nAge-specific values can be generated by specifying CVatAge as an array with dimensions nSim and nAge :\n\n4.4.1.3 Time- and Age-Specific Values\nThe same approach can be used to generate values that vary of both age and time:\n\n4.4.2 Populating MeanAtAge\n\nThe previous section described the different methods to populate CVatAge. Additional methods are used to populate MeanAtAge.\nThe methods described in this section are used to populate MeanAtAge for the Length object. The same process is used for all objects that contain MeanAtAge information (e.g., ?Weight, ?Maturity, ?Selectivitity, etc).\n\n4.4.2.1 Using Pars and Model\n\nThe first two arguments to the Length() function are Pars and Model (Figure 4.1).\nThese values are used to generate the MeanAtAge schedule from a growth model and corresponding parameter values.\nAlternatively, as described in the next section, MeanAtAge can be populated directly in a similar manner as described above for CVatAge.\nPars is a named list, with the names of the parameters for (in this case) the growth model specified in Model.\nopenMSE includes built-in models for all objects that contain MeanAtAge information. Currently there is one built-in length-at-age model, the von Bertalanffy growth function (see also ?vonBert:\n\\[\nL_a = L_\\infty(1-\\exp(-K(a-t_0))\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nIn general, a list of built-in models for a specific object class can be printed to the console with [CLASS]Models(). For example LengthModels() prints the built-in models corresponding to Length objects (Figure 4.2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Output printed in the console by LengthModels()\n\n\nIf the names in Pars corresponds with a built-in model, Model will be set automatically and does not need to be defined.\nAlternatively, Model can be a R function that takes an Ages object as the first argument followed by the additional parameters that describe the mean length-at-age relationship.\nThe output from LengthModels() shows that the vonBert function has three parameters: Linf, K, t0 (Figure 4.2). Values for these parameters must be entered in Pars in order to use this growth function.\nThe structure for the values contained in Pars is similar to that described for CVatLength above, where the values can be constant over all simulations and years, or vary by simulation and/or year.\n\n4.4.2.1.1 Constant Values over Simulations and Years\n\n4.4.2.1.2 Linf varies over Simulations, all Pars Constant over Years\n\n4.4.2.1.3 Time-Varying Parameters\nSpecifying time-varying parameters is a little more involved.\nUPTO HERE - break the code out into sections\n\n4.4.2.2 Populating MeanAtAge Directly\nHere the process to create and populate a Length object is broken into several steps. In practice this can be done in one or two lines of code.\nCreate a new Length object:\nThe mean length-at-age schedule is stored in a slot named MeanAtAge, which can be specified in two ways:\n\nA growth model and a list of the respective parameter values\nDirectly as an array specifying the mean length-at-age for each simulation and year.\n\n4.4.2.3 Model and Parameters\nThe Model and Pars slots are used to generate the mean length-at-age.\nModel specifies the growth function, and Pars is a named list with the parameter values.\n\nLength(SimpleStock) &lt;- Length(Pars=list())\n\nModel can either be a character string specifying the name of the growth model corresponding with the named parameters in Pars, or",
