    "text": "1.1 Backwards Compability\nopenMSE 2.0 represents a major update from earlier versions of openMSE and its component packages.\nThese updates include a complete code refactoring, where all existing source code was restructured to improve efficiency, readability, and ease of maintenance, and a redesign of the core object classes in the openMSE framework and the related functions .\nThe majority of these revisions have been done in the MSEtool package. The following package versions are required to use the new features of openMSE 2.0:\nThe openMSE 2.0 packages are completely backwards compatible with earlier versions, so all code developed using earlier versions of openMSE and its component packages should still work without any changes. Please file an issue if you experience issues where openMSE 2.0 has caused issues with existing code.\nOther than fixes to maintain backwards compatibility, the legacy code base will not be updated. For new applications, users are recommended to update to openMSE 2.0 and follow the structure outlined in this manual.",

    "text": "1.2 Overview of Major Changes\nThis section is primarily relevant to readers who have been working with openMSE in the past and are interested in learning about the technical differences between openMSE 2.0 and earlier versions of the packages.\nThe majority of the new developments have occurred in the MSEtool package. The most significant changes are the development of new object classes and new accessor and assignment functions related to those objects.\nTable 1.1 provides on overview of the new object classes, and some examples of the accessor and assignment functions that operate on those objects.\nLowercase names are used for all new object classes, however the accessor and assignment functions use either uppercase for acronyms (e.g., OM()) or regular case (e.g., Stock()).\nThe function examples in Table 1.1 are primarily intended for demonstration purposes and, particularly the assignment functions, in practice may require additional arguments. Consult the help documentation for the respective object class (e.g., ?OM ) for further information.\nThe new object classes and related functions are described in more detail elsewhere in this manual.\n\n\nTable 1.1: A brief description of the primary new object classes developed for openMSE 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Class\nDescription\nKey Functions Examples\nDeprecated Class\n\n\n\nom\n\nS4 object containing the operating model information.\nUsed for both single-stock/fleet and multi-stock/fleet models.\n\n\nOM(): Create new om-class object\n\nOM\nMOM\n\n\n\nstock\nS4 object containing information relating to the biological characteristics of a stock.\n\nStock() : Create a new stock-class object\nStock(OM) : Access a stock-class object from an om-class object\nStock(OM) &lt;- Stock() : Assign a stock-class object to an om-class object\n\nStock\n\n\nfleet\nS4 object containing information relating to the exploitation characteristics of a stock.\n\nFleet() : Create a new fleet-class object\nFleet(OM): Access a fleet-class object from an om-class object\nFleet(OM) &lt;- Fleet() : Assign a fleet-class object to an om-class object\n\nFleet\n\n\nobs\nS4 object containing information related to the observation model used to generate fishery data.\n\nObs() : Create a new obs-class object\nObs(OM): Access an obs-class object from an om-class object\nObs(OM) &lt;- Obs() : Assign an obs-class object to an om-class object\n\nObs\n\n\nimp\n\nS4 object containing information related to the implementation error for management advice produced by management procedures.\nNote: Implementation error is currently not implemented in openMSE 2.0 .\n\n\nImp() : Create a new imp-class object\nImp(OM): Access an imp-class object from an om-class object\nImp(OM) &lt;- Imp() : Assign an imp-class object to an om-class object\n\nImp\n\n\ndata\n\nS4 object containing information related to fishery data.\nA data-class object contains the data from all fleets in an OM .\nEach OM has a data-class object for each Stock , or for each stock complex.\n\n\nData() : Create a new data-class object\nData(OM): Access a data-class object from an om-class object\nData(OM) &lt;- Data() : Assign a data-class object to an om-class object\n\nData\n\n\nmp\nFunction that takes a data -class object and returns an advice-class object.\nMyMP &lt;- function(Data, ...) {\nAdvice()\n}\nclass(MyMP) &lt;- 'mp'\nMP\n\n\nadvice\nS4 object returned by a mp-class function and containing information related management advice.\n\nAdvice(): Create a new advice-class object\nRec\n\n\nhist\n\nS4 object containing the simulated historical fishery and information for future population dynamics.\nUsed for both single-stock/fleet and multi-stock/fleet models.\n\n\nHist(MSE) : return historical time series information from an mse-class object.\nNote: The object returned by Hist(MSE) is not a complete hist-class object, but only contains the historical time series data.
