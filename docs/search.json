The most significant changes are the development of new object classes and new accessor and assignment functions related to those objects.\nTable 1.1 provides on overview of the new object classes, and some examples of the accessor and assignment functions that operate on those objects.\nLowercase names are used for all new object classes, however the accessor and assignment functions use either uppercase for acronyms (e.g., OM()) or regular case (e.g., Stock()).\nThe function examples in Table 1.1 are primarily intended for demonstration purposes and, particularly the assignment functions, in practice may require additional arguments. Consult the help documentation for the respective object class (e.g., ?OM ) for further information.\nThe new object classes and related functions are described in more detail elsewhere in this manual.\n\n\nTable 1.1: A brief description of the primary new object classes developed for openMSE 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Class\nDescription\nKey Functions Examples\nDeprecated Class\n\n\n\nom\n\nS4 object containing the operating model information.\nUsed for both single-stock/fleet and multi-stock/fleet models.\n\n\nOM(): Create new om-class object\n\nOM\nMOM\n\n\n\nstock\nS4 object containing information relating to the biological characteristics of a stock.\n\nStock() : Create a new stock-class object\nStock(OM) : Access a stock-class object from an om-class object\nStock(OM) &lt;- Stock() : Assign a stock-class object to an om-class object\n\nStock\n\n\nfleet\nS4 object containing information relating to the exploitation characteristics of a stock.\n\nFleet() : Create a new fleet-class object\nFleet(OM): Access a fleet-class object from an om-class object\nFleet(OM) &lt;- Fleet() : Assign a fleet-class object to an om-class object\n\nFleet\n\n\nobs\nS4 object containing information related to the observation model used to generate fishery data.\n\nObs() : Create a new obs-class object\nObs(OM): Access an obs-class object from an om-class object\nObs(OM) &lt;- Obs() : Assign an obs-class object to an om-class object\n\nObs\n\n\nimp\n\nS4 object containing information related to the implementation error for management advice produced by management procedures.\nNote: Implementation error is currently not implemented in openMSE 2.0 .\n\n\nImp() : Create a new imp-class object\nImp(OM): Access an imp-class object from an om-class object\nImp(OM) &lt;- Imp() : Assign an imp-class object to an om-class object\n\nImp\n\n\ndata\n\nS4 object containing information related to fishery data.\nA data-class object contains the data from all fleets in an OM .\nEach OM has a data-class object for each Stock , or for each stock complex.\n\n\nData() : Create a new data-class object\nData(OM): Access a data-class object from an om-class object\nData(OM) &lt;- Data() : Assign a data-class object to an om-class object\n\nData\n\n\nmp\nFunction that takes a data -class object and returns an advice-class object.\nMyMP &lt;- function(Data, ...) {\nAdvice()\n}\nclass(MyMP) &lt;- 'mp'\nMP\n\n\nadvice\nS4 object returned by a mp-class function and containing information related management advice.\n\nAdvice(): Create a new advice-class object\nRec\n\n\nhist\n\nS4 object containing the simulated historical fishery and information for future population dynamics.\nUsed for both single-stock/fleet and multi-stock/fleet models.\n\n\nHist(MSE) : return historical time series information from an mse-class object.\nNote: The object returned by Hist(MSE) is not a complete hist-class object, but only contains the historical time series data.

    "text": "2.1 Overview of the MSE Process\nopenMSE has many features and can model a wide range of fishery dynamics, ranging from relatively simple single-stock single-fleet models to considerably more complex scenarios including multiple-stocks/fleets with an option for stock/fleet-specific management, age-dependent spatial structure, hermaphroditism, and between-stock biological interactions such as MICE (Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystems).\nProbably the easiest way to learn to use openMSE is to start with a relatively simple Example of the MSE Process. But first, users should become familiar with a conceptual overview of the MSE process and the primary objects and functions.\nopenMSE is designed with an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, where the code is organized around objects, which contain relevant data, and functions (methods) that operate on those data.\nFigure 2.1 shows a conceptual overview of the MSE process in openMSE, with colors indicating the primary objects and the functions.\nflowchart TD\n  build([&lt;a href='walkthrough.html'&gt;Build&lt;/a&gt;])\n  condition[[&lt;a href='OM_condition.html'&gt;Condition&lt;/a&gt;]]\n  import[[&lt;a href='OM_import.html'&gt;Import&lt;/a&gt;]]\n  convert[[&lt;a href='OM_convert.html'&gt;Convert&lt;/a&gt;]]\n  om[&lt;a href='object_om.html'&gt;OM&lt;/a&gt;]\n  build:::process --&gt; om\n  condition:::function --&gt; om\n  import:::function --&gt; om\n  convert:::function --&gt; om\n  sim[[&lt;a href='walkthrough_hist.html'&gt;Simulate&lt;/a&gt;]]\n  om:::object --&gt; sim:::function\n  hist[&lt;a href='object_hist.html'&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;]\n  sim --&gt; hist:::object\n  mp[[&lt;a href='management_procedures.html'&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;]]\n  data[&lt;a href='object_data.html'&gt;Data&lt;/a&gt;]\n  data:::object --&gt; mp\n  project[[&lt;a href='object_mse.html'&gt;Project&lt;/a&gt;]]\n  hist:::object --&gt; project:::function\n  mp:::function --&gt; project\n  mse[&lt;a href='object_mse.html'&gt;MSE&lt;/a&gt;]\n  project --&gt; mse:::object\n\n\nclassDef process fill:#fe218b, stroke:#111,stroke-width:1px, color:#000\nclassDef function fill:#fed700, stroke:#111,stroke-width:1px, color:#000\nclassDef object fill:#21b0fe, stroke:#111,stroke-width:1px, color:#000\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: An overview of the primary objects and functions used in the MSE process.",

    "section": "2.2 The OM Object",
    "text": "2.2 The OM Object\nThe Operating Model (OM) object is the main component of the MSE framework. An OM describes the characteristics of a fishery system and contains all the information required to simulate the population and fleet dynamics, the collection of fishery data, and the application of a management procedure.\nThe sections below briefly describe the various ways to construct an OM (Figure 2.1). Chapter 15 provides more details on the OM object.\n\n2.2.1 Build an OM\nThe first method, indicated by Build in Figure 2.1, is a process rather than applying a single function.\nThe build process involves creating a new OM object, and manually populating the various elements of the object using a combination of expert judgement and available fishery data.\nThis process is most often used in data-limited situations, where there is insufficient data or information to use one of the other approaches.\nThe next part in this manual, Example of the MSE Process, provides an example of constructing an OM using the Build process. Although this method may not be commonly used in practice, users are recommended to read through the examples in Example of the MSE Process to familiarize themselves with the general structure and contents of OM objects.\n\n\n2.2.2 Condition an OM\nOperating models are often generated by fitting a fishery population dynamics model to time-series fishery data (e.g., historical catches, indices of abundance, age and/or length compositions).\nThis process is known as OM conditioning, and is analogous to a conventional stock assessment. However, unlike a stock assessment where the aim is to provide a scientific estimate of the status of the stock (e.g., current biomass relative to a biological reference point), OMs are designed to incorporate the key uncertainties in the knowledge of the fishery system. In other words, while a stock assessment produces a single estimate of the historical fishery dynamics (aka the ‘best model’ approach), an operating model accounts for uncertainties and contains many different hypotheses of plausible fishery dynamics.\nopenMSE's Rapid Conditioning Model (RCM) is designed to condition operating models for a wide range of life-history types and data availability scenarios.\nChapter 11 provides an example of using the Condition function to condition an OM from fishery data.\n\n\n2.2.3 Import an OM\nopenMSE supports importing operating models from several commonly used stock assessment frameworks, including Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) and the Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM).\nChapter 12 provides an example of using the Import functions to import an OM from stock assessment output.\n\n\n2.2.4 Convert an OM\nThe Convert function is used to convert OM objects (as well as other objects) that were created in earlier versions of openMSE (see Chapter 1) to the new object structure developed in openMSE 2.0.\nChapter 13 provides an example of using the Convert function to convert OM objects developed with earlier versions of openMSE to be compatible with openMSE 2.0.",

However, the openMSE objects have been designed such that users only need to enter the minimal information to populate the model.\nIn this example, the values for MeanAtAge are defined by means of a list of named parameters (Pars) for a built-in growth function (vonBert):\n\nLength(ExampleStock) &lt;- Length(\n  Pars = list(\n    Linf = c(121, 135),\n    K = c(0.16, 0.22),\n    t0 = c(-1.86, -1.41)\n  ),\n  Model = \"vonBert\",\n  CVatAge = c(0.1, 0.15)\n)\n\nThe parameters for the vonBert function and the values for CVatAge are entered as lower and upper bounds of a uniform distribution. Internally, nSim values for the Linf, K, and t0 parameters will be sampled from uniform distributions, and these used to calculate the values for MeanAtAge. Similarly, nSim values will be sampled for CVatAge and used within each simulation as a constant value over all simulations and time steps.\nThere are many other ways to populate Length objects, including sampling from non-uniform distributions and having values vary over time.\nSee Chapter 18 for more details on the Length object.",

See the Ages section below for an example.\nAdditionally, because it is used to set up the time and age structure of the model, the Seasons value should not be changed once an operating model is constructed.",

    "text": "18.1 Methods for Populating Age- and Time-Dynamic Values\nThe Length() function is used to create Length objects. The help documentation for this function (?Length) provides details on the contents of the Length object and a description of the arguments for the Length() function (Figure 18.1).\nUltimately, users must provide information to populate MeanAtAge and CVatAge in a Length object. MeanAtAge is common to all objects that contain at-age information, and, as the name suggests, contains information describing the mean at-age schedule (in this case the mean length-at-age). CVatAge contains the coefficient of variability for the distribution of length-at-age, which can be either normally (Dist='normal') or log-normally (Dist='lognormal') distributed around MeanAtAge.\nInternally, both MeanAtAge and CVatAge will be 3-dimensional arrays with dimensions containing values for each simulation, age-class, and historical and projection time step (typically years but as noted above, for seasonal models the time steps will actually be decimal years). However, the openMSE objects have been designed such that users only need to enter the minimal information to populate the model.\nIn this example, the values for MeanAtAge are defined by means of a list of named parameters (Pars) for a built-in growth function (vonBert):\nThe parameters for the vonBert function and the values for CVatAge are entered as lower and upper bounds of a uniform distribution. Internally, nSim values for the Linf, K, and t0 parameters will be sampled from uniform distributions, and these used to calculate the values for MeanAtAge. Similarly, nSim values will be sampled for CVatAge.\nThis is done internally by the Populate function, which is run here on the Length object to demonstrate:\nNotice that, because in this object mean length-at-age is constant over time, while MeanAtAge is a 3-dimensional array, the third dimension (Year) is only length 1 and named as the first historical year. Similarly, while CVatAge is a 3-dimensional array, the dimensions Age and Year are only length 1 and named as the first age-class and year respectively. Internally, these array will be expanded out for all age-classes and years.\nThere are several other ways to specify values for Pars, MeanAtAge, and CVatAge, including using alternative growth functions, and specifying values that vary over time and/or ages. These methods are discussed in more detail in Chapter 18.\nExamples …\nPars, MeanAtAge ….",

    "text": "18.2 Length\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMany sub-objects in the Stock object are structured and populated in a similar manner to Length objects.\nThis section describes populating Length objects in detail. The other sub-objects with a similar structure are described in less detail.\nReaders should refer back to this section for the specific details for the different ways to populate those objects.\n\n\nFigure 18.1 shows the that default value for CVatAge is a single numeric value 0.1. This value will be converted internally to an array with the correct dimensions, with a CV of 0.1 for all simulations, ages, and time steps.\n\n18.2.1 Populating CVatAge\n\nFigure 18.1 shows the that default value for CVatAge is a single numeric value 0.1. This value will be converted internally to an array with the correct dimensions, with a CV of 0.1 for all simulations, ages, and time steps.\nThere are several ways to include uncertainty in the values for CVatAge , and have it vary by simulation, age, and/or time step. These approaches are described in the sub-sections below. In general, all age- and time-dynamic values can be populated in the same manner.\n\n18.2.1.1 Stochastic Samples from Distributions\nThe easiest way to include uncertainty is to sample from a uniform distribution. To do this, enter to numeric values representing the lower and upper bounds of a uniform distribution:\nThe above code creates a new Length class object with only the CVatAge slot populated.\nThis object is processed internally to sample from a uniform distribution with these bounds and produce an array with the correct dimensions.\nThis is done internally by the Populate function, which is run here on the Length_CV_uniform object to demonstrate:\nIn practice, users will rarely need to call the Populate function as this processing is done internally in the Simulate function.\nCVatAge in Length_CV_uniform is now a 3-dimensional array:\nwith the value for each simulation drawn from a uniform distribution with the specified bounds:\nOnce an object has been populated by Populate , all dimensions will be named:\nNotice that while CVatAge is a 3-dimensional array, the dimensions Age and Year are only length 1 and named as the first age-class and year respectively. This is because CVatAge in this example only varies by simulation and is constant for all ages-classes and years. Internally, the array will be expanded out for all age-classes and years.\nThe values for CVatAge can also be entered as a vector of length nSim (provided nSim &gt; 2 ). The following are will result in the same output as the code above:\nThis approach can be also used to sample values from different distributions, for example:\n\n18.2.1.2 Age-Specific Values\nAge-specific values can be generated by specifying CVatAge as an array with dimensions nSim and nAge :\n\n18.2.1.3 Time- and Age-Specific Values\nThe same approach can be used to generate values that vary of both age and time:\n\n18.2.2 Populating MeanAtAge\n\nThe previous section described the different methods to populate CVatAge. Additional methods are used to populate MeanAtAge.\nThe methods described in this section are used to populate MeanAtAge for the Length object. The same process is used for all objects that contain MeanAtAge information (e.g., ?Weight, ?Maturity, ?Selectivitity, etc).\n\n18.2.2.1 Using Pars and Model\n\nThe first two arguments to the Length() function are Pars and Model (Figure 18.1).\nThese values are used to generate the MeanAtAge schedule from a growth model and corresponding parameter values.\nAlternatively, as described in the next section, MeanAtAge can be populated directly in a similar manner as described above for CVatAge.\nPars is a named list, with the names of the parameters for (in this case) the growth model specified in Model.\nopenMSE includes built-in models for all objects that contain MeanAtAge information. Currently there is one built-in length-at-age model, the von Bertalanffy growth function (see also ?vonBert:\n\\[\nL_a = L_\\infty(1-\\exp(-K(a-t_0))\n\\tag{18.1}\\]\nIn general, a list of built-in models for a specific object class can be printed to the console with [CLASS]Models(). For example LengthModels() prints the built-in models corresponding to Length objects (Figure 18.2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.2: Output printed in the console by LengthModels()\n\n\nIf the names in Pars corresponds with a built-in model, Model will be set automatically and does not need to be defined.\nAlternatively, Model can be a R function that takes an Ages object as the first argument followed by the additional parameters that describe the mean length-at-age relationship.\nThe output from LengthModels() shows that the vonBert function has three parameters: Linf, K, t0 (Figure 18.2). Values for these parameters must be entered in Pars in order to use this growth function.\nThe structure for the values contained in Pars is similar to that described for CVatLength above, where the values can be constant over all simulations and years, or vary by simulation and/or year.\n\n18.2.2.1.1 Constant Values over Simulations and Years\n\n18.2.2.1.2 Linf varies over Simulations, all Pars Constant over Years\n\n18.2.2.1.3 Time-Varying Parameters\nSpecifying time-varying parameters is a little more involved.\n\n18.2.2.2 Populating MeanAtAge Directly\nHere the process to create and populate a Length object is broken into several steps. In practice this can be done in one or two lines of code.\nCreate a new Length object:\nThe mean length-at-age schedule is stored in a slot named MeanAtAge, which can be specified in two ways:\n\nA growth model and a list of the respective parameter values\nDirectly as an array specifying the mean length-at-age for each simulation and year.\n\n18.2.2.3 Model and Parameters\nThe Model and Pars slots are used to generate the mean length-at-age.\nModel specifies the growth function, and Pars is a named list with the parameter values.\n\nModel can either be a character string specifying the name of the growth model corresponding with the named parameters in Pars, or",
