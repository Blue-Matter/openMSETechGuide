# Getting Started 

`openMSE` has many features and can model a wide range of fishery dynamics, ranging from relatively simple single-stock single-fleet models to considerably more complex scenarios including multiple-stocks/fleets with an option for stock/fleet-specific management, age-dependent spatial structure, hermaphroditism, and between-stock biological interactions such as MICE (Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystems).

Probably the easiest way to learn to use `openMSE` is to start with a walkthrough of the MSE process with a relatively simple example. But first, users should become familiar with a conceptual overview of the MSE process and the primary objects and functions.

## Overview of the MSE Process 

`openMSE` is designed around an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, where the code is organized around **objects**, which contain relevant data, and **functions** (methods) that operate on those data.


@fig-flowchart shows a conceptual overview of the MSE process in `openMSE`, with colors indicating the primary [**objects**]{style="background:#21b0fe;"} and [**functions**]{style="background:#fed700;"}.

The following sub-sections describe these primary objects and the functions that either operate on them, or are used to create them.

## The OM Object

The Operating Model (`OM`) object is the main component of the MSE framework. An `OM` describes the characteristics of a fishery system and contains all the information required to simulate the population and fleet dynamics, the collection of fishery data, and the  application of a management procedure.

There are several ways to construct an `OM` (@fig-flowchart). These methods are briefly described in the sections below. 

### Build an OM

The first method, indicated by [`Build`]{style="background:#fe218b;"} in @fig-flowchart, is a process rather than applying a single function. 

The build process involves creating a new `OM` object, and manually populating the various elements of the object using a combination of expert judgement and available fishery data. 

This process is most often used in data-limited situations, where there is insufficient data or information to use one of the other approaches.

@sec-om_build provides an example of using the `Build` process to construct an `OM`. 

Although this method may not be commonly used in practice, users are recommended to read start with @sec-om_build  to familiarize themselves to the structure and contents of `OM` objects. 

### Condition an OM 

Operating models are often generated by fitting a fishery population dynamics model to time-series fishery data (e.g., historical catches, indices of abundance, age and/or length compositions). 

This process is known as OM conditioning, and is analogous to a conventional stock assessment. However, unlike a stock assessment where the aim is to provide a scientific estimate of the status of the stock (e.g., current biomass relative to a biological reference point), OMs are designed to incorporate the key uncertainties in the knowledge of the fishery system. In other words, while a stock assessment produces a single estimate of the historical fishery dynamics (aka the ‘best model’ approach), an operating model accounts for uncertainties and contains many different hypotheses of plausible fishery dynamics.

`openMSE's` [Rapid Conditioning Model (RCM)](https://samtool.openmse.com/reference/RCM.html) is designed to condition operating models for a wide range of life-history types and data availability scenarios.

@sec-om_condition provides an example of using the `Condition` function to condition an `OM` from fishery data.

### Import an OM 

`openMSE` supports importing operating models from several commonly used stock assessment frameworks, including [Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3)](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/ss3-website/) and the [Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM)](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/4847).

@sec-om_import provides an example of using the `Import` function to import an `OM` from stock assessment output.

### Convert an OM 

The `Convert` function is used to convert `OM` objects (as well as other objects) that were created in earlier versions of `openMSE` (see @sec-openmse) to the new object structure developed in `openMSE 2.0`. 

@sec-om_convert provides an example of using the `Convert` function to convert `OM` objects developed with earlier versions of `openMSE` to be compatible with `openMSE 2.0`. 


## The Hist Object

`Hist` objects are created by applying the `Simulate` function to `OM` objects (@fig-flowchart).

`Hist` objects contain the simulated historical fishery dynamics and are used to project the model forward in time under a range of different management policies (i.e., management procedures).

## The MSE Object

`MSE` objects are created by applying the `Project` function to `Hist` objects, together with the management procedure (`MP`) functions that will be used to provide the management advice that was implemented in the simulated fishery (@fig-flowchart).

`MSE` objects contain the fishery dynamics from both the historical period (`Hist`) and the projection period where the `MPs` were applied.
