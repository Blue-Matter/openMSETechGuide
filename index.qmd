# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the **openMSE Technical Manual**.

This book is intended for fisheries scientists and other analysts who wish to learn how to use `openMSE` for all aspects of Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE):

-   building operating models;
-   developing management procedures;
-   conducting closed-loop simulation testing;
-   summarizing and presenting results.

For more general information about `openMSE` see the [openMSE website](http://openMSE.com).

::: {.callout-warning}
This Technical Manual has been developed for `openMSE 2.0`, which is currently under development and has not yet been released on CRAN. 

The code in this manual is only compatible with the development branches of `MSEtool`, `SAMtool`, `DLMtool`, and `openMSE`. 

Unless you are feeling particulary adventurous, you should not use the development code for your analyses!
