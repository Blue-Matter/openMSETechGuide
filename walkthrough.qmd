# Example of the MSE Process {#sec-walkthrough}

The chapters in this section follows the **Build** process indicated in @fig-flowchart to construct and populate an example `OM`, and then go through the process of simulating the historical fishery, developing some example management procedures, conducting the forward projections, and examining the MSE results.


In most cases, users will likely use other methods to construct OMs, such as `Condition` (@sec-om_condition) or `Import` (@sec-om_import), where many of the steps described in the first few chapters of this section are done automatically.

However, new users are recommended to read through these chapters to understand the overall structure and contents of `OM` objects.
