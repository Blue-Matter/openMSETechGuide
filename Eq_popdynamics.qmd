# Population Dynamics 

## Number at Age

### Initial

- annual 
- seasonal  - initialized to account for seasonal recruitment

Notes:

- age of recruitment is `MinAge(Stock)`
- `MinAge(Stock) == 0` means that recruitment occurs in same time step as `SProduction`
- otherwise lagged by appropriate number of time steps (year, quarters, months)
