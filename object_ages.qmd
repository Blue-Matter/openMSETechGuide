# `Ages` Object {#sec-object_ages}

An `Ages` object contains information relating to the age structure of the stock.

```{r create-ages_1}
```

Note that `MaxAge` is set in time units of `quarter`. It is important that the time units in the `Ages` object matches the number of seasons in the `OM`.

Also note that, following the convention in `Years(OM)` the age classes are *always* in units of year:

```{r classes-ages}
```

To keep things simple, we'll change our `OM` back to annual time-steps and re-recreate the `Ages` object accordingly:

```{r create-ages_2}
```
