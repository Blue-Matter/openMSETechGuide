| [![](/images/OpenMSE.png)](#openMSE) | `openMSE` is an umbrella package that contains the three core packages for constructing operating models and simulating fishery dynamics (`MSEtool`), applying data-limited management procedures (`DLMtool`), and conditioning operating models with data and applying more data-intensive assessment methods (`SAMtool`). |

[Installing and loading](/prerequisites.html) the `openMSE` package will all functions in the `openMSE` universe available in the R session.

| [![](/images/MSEtool.png)](https://msetool.openMSE.com)  | The Management Strategy Evaluation toolkit [(MSEtool)](https://msetool.openMSE.com) is the core package in the `openMSE` collection. It contains all the core functions for constructing operating models, simulating fishery dynamics, and evaluating the effectiveness of alternative management strategies. You can learn more about the specific functions in the `MSEtool` package at the [MSEtool documentation site](https://msetool.openMSE.com).                                                                                              |
| [![](/images/DLMtool.png)](https://dlmtool.openMSE.com/) | The Data-Limited Methods toolkit [(DLMtool)](https://dlmtool.openMSE.com) is a collection of data-limited management procedures that have been developed for applications where it is not possible (or not desirable) to apply more conventional data-intensive assessment methods. You can learn more about the specific functions in the `DLMtool` package at the [DLMtool documentation site](https://dlmtool.openMSE.com/). `DLMtool` uses the `MSEtool` package as a dependency, and loading DLMtool will make all `MSEtool` functions available. |
| [![](/images/SAMtool.png)](https://samtool.openMSE.com)  | The Stock Assessment Methods toolkit [(SAMtool)](https://samtool.openMSE.com) is a collection of more data-intensive stock assessment methods and models for conditioning operating models with fishery data. You can learn more about the specific functions in the SAMtool package at the [SAMtool documentation site](https://samtool.openMSE.com). `SAMtool` uses the `MSEtool` package as a dependency, and loading `SAMtool` will make all `MSEtool` functions available.                                                                        |
