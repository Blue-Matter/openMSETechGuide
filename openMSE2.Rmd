# openMSE 2.0 


During 2024 and 2025, `openMSE` and the [component packages](\rPackages.html) 
underwent fairly significant developments, including a major code refactor. 

`openMSE v2.0` was released in 202X. Although all updates to the code are backwards
compatible, to benefit from the recent developments you should make sure you have
installed the most recent versions of the component 
packages: `MSEtool v4.0+`, `DLMtool v7.0+` and `SAMtool v2.0+`.
