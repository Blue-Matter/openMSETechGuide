|https://msetool.openMSE.com[image:.\images/MSEtool.png[.\images/MSEtool]] |The Management Strategy Evaluation toolkit https://msetool.openMSE.com[(MSEtool)] is the core package in the `+openMSE+` collection. It contains all the core functions for constructing operating models, simulating fishery dynamics, and evaluating the effectiveness of alternative management strategies. You can learn more about the specific functions in the `+MSEtool+` package at the https://msetool.openMSE.com[MSEtool documentation site].
|https://dlmtool.openMSE.com/[image:.\images/DLMtool.png[.\images/DLMtool]] |The Data-Limited Methods toolkit https://dlmtool.openMSE.com[(DLMtool)] is a collection of data-limited management procedures that have been developed for applications where it is not possible (or not desirable) to apply more conventional data-intensive assessment methods. You can learn more about the specific functions in the `+DLMtool+` package at the https://dlmtool.openMSE.com/[DLMtool documentation site]. `+DLMtool+` uses the `+MSEtool+` package as a dependency, and loading DLMtool will make all `+MSEtool+` functions available.
|https://samtool.openMSE.com[image:.\images/SAMtool.png[.\images/SAMtool]] |The Stock Assessment Methods toolkit https://samtool.openMSE.com[(SAMtool)] is a collection of more data-intensive stock assessment methods and models for conditioning operating models with fishery data. You can learn more about the specific functions in the SAMtool package at the https://samtool.openMSE.com[SAMtool documentation site]. `+SAMtool+` uses the `+MSEtool+` package as a dependency, and loading `+SAMtool+` will make all `+MSEtool+` functions available.
