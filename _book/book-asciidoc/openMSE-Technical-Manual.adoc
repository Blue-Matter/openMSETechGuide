:toc:
:doctype: book

== Welcome

Welcome to the *openMSE Technical Manual* developed and written by Adrian Hordyk, Quang Huynh, and Tom Carruthers from http://bluematterscience.com[Blue Matter Science].

This book is intended for fisheries scientists and other analysts who wish to learn how to use `+openMSE+` for all aspects of Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE):

* building operating models;
* developing management procedures;
* conducting closed-loop simulation testing;
* summarizing and presenting results.

For more general information about `+openMSE+` see the http://openMSE.com[openMSE website].

____
This Technical Manual has been developed for `+openMSE 2.0+`, which is currently under development and will be released in 2025. The code in this manual is only compatible with the development branches of `+MSEtool+`, `+SAMtool+`, `+DLMtool+`, and `+openMSE+`. Unless you are feeling particulary adventurous, you should not use the development code for your analyses!
