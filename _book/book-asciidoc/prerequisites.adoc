:description: Management Strategy Evaluation with openMSE

To use `+openMSE+` or any of its component packages you must have:

[arabic]
. A recent version of the R software installed on your machine;
. While not essential, we highly recommend using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio;
. The latest version of `+openMSE+` or the individual component packages installed.

== Installing R

The R statistical language and environment can be freely downloaded from the https://cran.r-project.org/[CRAN website] and is available for all operating systems. Updated versions of R are released frequently, and it is recommended that you have the latest version installed.

Head to the https://cran.r-project.org/[CRAN website] to download the latest version of R.

You can check your version of R by typing `+version+` into the R console.

== RStudio

https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/[RStudio] is a freely available integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It is not essential that you use RStudio, but it can make things a lot easier, especially if you are new to R.

It is important to be aware that RStudio and R are two different pieces of software that must be installed separately. We recommend installing the R software before downloading and installing RStudio.

== Installing the Packages

=== Installing `+openMSE+`

All component packages in the `+openMSE+` collection can be installed with:

[source,r,cell-code]
----
install.packages('openMSE')
----

and loaded into the R session with:

[source,r,cell-code]
----
library('openMSE')
----

This will load the `+openMSE+` package, and make all functions in `+MSEtool+`, `+DLMtool+`, and `+SAMtool+` available.

=== Installing the component packages

To install only the core MSE functions, install and load the Management Strategy Evaluation toolkit with: `+install.packages('MSEtool')+` and `+library('MSEtool')+`.

To install and load the Data-Limited Methods toolkit use: `+install.packages('DLMtool')+` and `+library('DLMtool')+`. Note that this will also install and load the dependency `+MSEtool+`.

To install and load the Stock Assessment Methods toolkit use: `+install.packages('SAMtool')+` and `+library('SAMtool')+`. Note that this will also install and load the dependency `+MSEtool+`.

== Assumed Knowledge

The `+openMSE+` packages have been designed to be accessible for all users and do not assume a high level of knowledge of R. The functions and help documentation material have been constructed in such a way that a user with little experience with R should be able to run the MSE and apply the methods to their data.

Little programming experience is required to use the package. However, users of the `+openMSE+` packages should have some familiarity with R, and be comfortable with using the command line. The help documentation attempts to explain the use of the `+openMSE+` functions and features in easy to follow steps, but familiarity with the most common R functions is assumed.
