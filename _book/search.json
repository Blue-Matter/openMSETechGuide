    "text": "openMSE is an umbrella R package for building operating models, analyzing fishery data, and conducting Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for a wide range of fisheries.\nopenMSE uses an age-structured spatial population dynamics model to simulate fishery dynamics. Full details of the population dynamics model are available in a paper published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.\nThe openMSE package is available on CRAN can be installed with install.packages(\"openMSE\"). Installing the openMSE package and loading with library(\"openMSE\") will load the following core packages:\n\nMSEtool - the Management Strategy Evaluation toolkit is the core package in the openMSE collection. It contains the core functions for constructing operating models, simulating fishery dynamics, and evaluating the effectiveness of alternative management strategies using closed-loop simulation testing.\nDLMtool - the Data-Limited Methods toolkit is a collection of data-limited management procedures that can be evaluated using MSE. DLMtool requires the MSEtool package as a dependency, and all MSEtool functions will be available when DLMtool is loaded into an R session.\nSAMtool - the Stock Assessment Methods toolkit is a collection of assessment methods and management procedures that have been developed for more data-intensive applications. This package includes the Rapid Conditioning Model for conditioning operating models in data-moderate and data-rich fisheries. SAMtool requires the MSEtool package as a dependency, and all MSEtool functions will be available when SAMtool is loaded into an R session.\n\nTo learn more about the specifics of the openMSE packages see Chapter 3.",

    "text": "6.1 Management Strategy Evaluation\nManagement Strategy Evaluation (MSE) is a computer simulation approach for testing prospective management options over a wide range of possible realities for the fishery and the population. Ideally, management options can be identified that are robust and perform well over all credible scenarios for the fishery.\nIt is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to conduct large-scale experiments to evaluate directly the trade-offs associated with fisheries management. Even among well-studied fisheries, considerable uncertainty often exists regarding stock status and the dynamics of the fishery, and it can be difficult to attribute particular outcomes to distinct management actions. The mathematical description of fish population dynamics and the interaction with different exploitation patterns, first developed by Beverton and Holt (1957), together with the advent of powerful and affordable computers, has allowed the development of the MSE approach (Butterworth, 2007; Nils Bunnefeld et al., 2011; Punt et al., 2016).\nManagement strategy evaluation was originally developed by the International Whaling Commission as a tool to evaluate the various trade-offs involved the management of marine mammals, and to guide the decision-making process for selecting an appropriate management strategy. Since its development in the mid-1970s, MSE has become widely used in fisheries science and is routinely applied to evaluate the trade-offs in alternative management strategies of many of the world’s fisheries.\nAn MSE is usually comprised of four key components:\nThe management recommendations by each management procedure are then fed-back into the operating model and projected forward one-time step. The process of simulating the population dynamics of the fishery along with the management process that feeds back and impacts the simulated fish population is known as closed-loop simulation.\nA benefit of closed-loop simulation is that it allows the direct comparison and evaluation of alternative management strategies against perfect knowledge of the simulated system; something that is impossible in the real world (Walters and Martell, 2004). With the aid of computer simulation, it is possible to run many hundreds of simulation runs for each management procedure being evaluated - each representing a different possible simulated future of what could happen to the fishery under various management strategies - and to take into account the uncertainty in knowledge of the stock and fishery (i.e., errors in observation), as well as the uncertainty in future environmental and ecological conditions that are likely to affect the stock dynamics.\nThrough these simulations, MSE reveals the relative impacts of specified management approaches to their fishery decades into the future and enables managers to choose the approach that best achieves their management objectives, as articulated through a set of well-defined performance metrics.",

In some cases this can be a stock assessment model that estimates the status of the (simulated) stock and linked to a harvest control rule to generate management advice from the output of the assessment. In other cases, the management procedure can be simple empirical rules that produce management advice directly from the observed fishery data (e.g., an index targeting method). The key feature of a management procedure is that it is reproducible and objective: that is, the same data will always result in the same management recommendation;\nan implementation model that describes how the management advice generated by the management procedures is implemented back into the simulated fishery.",

    "text": "6.2 How does Management Strategy Evaluation Differ from Stock Assessment?\nStock assessments are intended to provide one-off management advice, such as a catch limit (e.g. 20,000 tonnes), based on historical data. However, a stock assessment on its own provides no knowledge of the expected performance of the assessment, harvest control rule, or management system in general.\nIn an assessment setting there is no way to know whether a simpler assessment using other data might provide more robust performance (e.g. less overfishing, more yield) over a time horizon that managers are considering (e.g. the next 30 years). Management strategy evaluation tests a range of management approaches (of which an assessment linked to a harvest control rule is one such approach) and offers a scientific basis for selecting a management approach. MSE does not provide a catch-limit in tonnes, it identifies a modus operandi that will provide the desired management performance (it is analogous to selecting a suitable airplane via flight simulation testing rather than actually flying a plane to a specific destination).\nThe advantage of MSE over stock assessment is that it is possible to consider a much wider range of uncertainty in stock dynamics, fleet dynamics, and data collection, which often better represents the state of knowledge (particularly for data-limited stocks). No matter how much uncertainty is factored into the MSE, a single management approach may be selected that can provide management advice.\nMSE was specifically introduced in controversial fishery settings where it was not possible to decide the ‘best’ representation of the state of nature. In the end, MSE was used to circumvent this problem by including all possible states of nature, often revealing that the disputes were in fact inconsequential all along.\n\n\n\n\nBeverton, R.J.H., Holt, S.J., 1957.

The LengthModels() function can be used to display the built-in growth models in the R console.\nTo use a built-in model, Pars must be a named list, with the names matching those listed under the Pars displayed by LengthModels() for the relevant model.\nFor example, to use the von Bertalanffy growth model (vonBert):\n\nlength &lt;- Length(Pars=list(Linf=100, \n                           K=0.2,\n                           t0=-0.1))\n\nModel will be automatically populated with the matching model name:\n\nModel(length)\n\n[1] \"vonBert\"\n\n\nAn error will occur if the named elements of Pars does not exactly match the parameters in one of the models listed in LengthModels(), e.g.,\n\nlength &lt;- Length(Pars=list(Linf=100, \n                           K=0.2))\n\nError in `CheckModel()` at MSEtool/R/Find.R:55:5:\n! No model found for this object class \"length\" with parameters named:\n  \"Linf\" and \"K\".\nℹ See `LengthModels()` or set `Pars` to NULL or `Model` to a R function with\n  arguments corresponding with those in `Pars`.\n\n\n\n11.2.1.1 Structure of Pars\n\nThe elements in the Pars list can be structured in several different ways to deal with\n\nLengthModels()\n\nModel: `?MSEtool2::vonBert()`\n\n\nPars: `Linf`, `K`, and `t0`\n\n\nOther argument(s): `Ages`\n\n\nClass: `Length-at-Age-Model`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Entering Length-at-Age Directly with MeanAtAge\n\nAlternatively, the mean length-at-age schedule can be passed as a 3-dimensional array directly into the MeanAtAge slot:\n\nlength &lt;- Length(MeanAtAge = )\n\n\n11.2.3 Distribution of Length-at-Age\n\n11.2.4 Units\nUnits\n\n11.2.5 Timing\n\n11.2.6 Classes",
